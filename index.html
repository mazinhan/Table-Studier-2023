                    <dd>When checked, accurate answers will disappear from the answer bin. Answers in the bin will move around as

                <h2>Updates</h2>
                <p>I'll try to update it whenever the tests update. If there's a new test and I haven't updated, yet, feel free to
                    drop me a note at the e-mail address above.</p>
                <h2>Have Something to Add?</h2>
                <p>This thing is pretty easy to update, so if you think something should be added or you want to put together some
                    tables for a different exam, you can find instructions for how to format the tables on

            6	Presentation	Responsible for the presentation of data (for example, the transition of character sets-e.g., ASCII to EBCDIC).
            5	Session	Responsible for establishing and maintaining a communications "session".
            4	Transport	Responsible for providing reliable end-to-end communications, including most of the error control and flow.
            3	Network	Responsible for providing logical network addressing.  Some error and flow control is performed at this level.
            2	Data Link	Responsible for logical topology and logical (MAC) addressing.  Individual network card addresses also function at this level.
            1	Physical	Responsible for placing the network data on the wire, by changing binary data into electrical pulses on the physical medium.  The physical topology is defined at this level.

            1	Preamble	7 octets	An alternating pattern of 1s and 0s used for synchronization.
            2	Start frame delimiter	1 octet	A binary 8-bit sequence of 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 that indicates the start of the frame.
            3	Destination MAC address	6 octets	Each computer has an Ethernet network interface card (NIC) or network adapter that has a unique media access control.
            4	Source MAC address	6 octets	MAC address associated with it. The MAC address is 6 bytes (12 hex characters) in length.
            5	Length/type	2 octets	An indication of the number of bytes in the data field if this value is less than 1500. If this number is greater than 1500, it indicates the type of data format—for example, IP and IPX.
            6	Data	46 - 1500 octets	The variable length of data being transferred from the source to the destination.
            7	Pad		A field used to bring the total number of bytes up to the minimum of 46 if the data field is less than 46 bytes.
            8	Frame check sequence	4 octets	A 4-byte CRC value used for error detection. The CRC is performed on the bits from the destination MAC address through the Pad fields. If an error is detected, the frame is discarded.
            9	Interpacket gap	12+ octets	After a packet has been sent, transmitters are required to transmit a minimum of 96 bits (12 octets) of idle line state before transmitting the next packet.
